#  **classification-challenge**
### By: Kyle Kerner

In this program we assume we are working at an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and we have been tasked with improving the email filtering system for its customers.  With a provided dataset containing information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam, we take the dataset and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that accurately detects spam emails to filter.  

The two classification models used were the logistic regression model and a random forest model.  The data was fit, scaled, splot into trainig and testing data.  From there the logistic regression and random forest model's were both fit with the scaled data.  Further the predictions were made on the data and the fitted models. After this was complete the models performance were compared based on accuracy scores.
